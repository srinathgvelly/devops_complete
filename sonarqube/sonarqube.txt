Sonarqube is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in code.
Sonarqube can integrate with existing workflow to enable continous code inspection across the project branch and pull requests.

	 -->Developers develop and merge the code in IDE and check in their code to ALM.
	 -->Organisation CI tool checks out, builds and runs unit tests and integrate sonarqube scanner which analyzes the results.
	 -->Scanner posts the results to the sonarqube server which provides feedback to developers through sonarqube interface.

Sonarqube Scanner:
	 -->Setting up analysis:		Analyzing starts with installing and configuring a soanrqube scanner.
									The scanner can either run on build or as a part of CI pipeline performing  scan when build is triggered.
	 -->Analyzing Branches :		Happens in developer edition. To ensure the code quality is consistent till the branch level of the project.
	 -->Analyzing Pull request : 	Sonarqube can be a part of pull merge request. This trigger branch analysis and add pull request decoration 
									to set branch analysis directly in ALM's interface & soanrqube interface.

Tools for writing clean and Safe Code:

	  -->Sonarlint :		Is a editor, gives immediate feedback to catch and fix issues before send to repository.
	  -->Quality Gate : 	Checks if the project is ready for Production.
	  -->Clean as Code :	Eliminates lot of challenges that comes with traditional approach.
	  -->Issues:			Sonarqube raises issues whenever piece of code breaks coding rules, error that breaks code at point in code open to 
							to attack vulnerabilities.
	  -->Securityhotspots : Security sensitivity piece of code need to be reviewed. Upon review you will either find their is no threat or need
							to apply fix to secure code.
