Scrum is a framework, it works on complex adaptive problems.
In a nutshell, scrum requires scrum master to faster an environment where :
	  --> Product owner orders work for problem in product backlog
	  --> Scrum team makes the work into increment of work in sprint
	  --> Scrum team and stake holders inspect the results and adjust for next sprint.

scrum is founded on two things empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism tells 
	  --> knowledge comes from experience 
	  --> decision making is based on observation
 lean thinking is reduces unwanted things and focues on the important things.

scrum approach is Iterative and Incremental 
inorder to achieve Predictibility and Risk Control

scrum pillars --> Transperency + Inspection + Adaption.

Transparency : Means aspects of the process can be visible to people responsible for the outcome.
	  --> Transparency enables inspection. inspection without transparency is wasteful and misleading.

Inspection : Scrum artifacts inspects the progress towards the sprint goal inspection happens frequently if it comes in the way of  work inspection is not done frequently.
	  --> Inspection enables Adaption. Inspection without adaption is pointless.

Adaption : If the process and resulting product aspects deviate out of acceptable limits:Process or material must be adjusted.
scrum team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything through inspection.

Scrum Values :
      --> commitment : People are committed to work to acheieve goals
      --> focus : focus on work and goal
      --> openness : be open to work and challenges 
      --> repect : respect people to be capable and independent
      --> courage : courage to do work and work on tough problems
              
Scrum team :
      --> Scrum Master 
      --> Product Owner 
      --> Developer
        
 Scrum Teams are Self Organising and Cross Functional (Teams have all competences needed.No dependency of outsiders. 
        
Development Team :
	  --> Professionals who deliver a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.
	  --> Members may have specialised skills, but accountability belongs to the team as a whole.
	  --> Development Team Size =3 to 9 people.

Product Owner:
	  --> Responsible for maximising the value of the work done by the Development Team.
	  --> Product Owner is  1 single person. May represent the desires of a group/committee.
	  --> Product Owner is solely accountable for the Product Backlog. He owns it.
	  --> Anyone who wants to change Product Backlog priorities, must address the Product Owner.

Scrum Master:
	  --> Promote and support Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.
	  --> Help those outside of team to understand which interaction are helpful and which aren't.
	  --> Scrum Master is a true leader.
	  --> Service to the Product Owner,development team and the organisation in several ways,

Scrum Events :
      --> Sprint Planning
      --> Daily Scrum
      --> Sprint Review
      --> Sprint Retrospective
      --> Sprint
             
 Create regularity
 Minimize the need for other meetings     
 Designed for critical transparency and inspection.

Sprint :
	  --> One month or less
	  --> Starts immediately after the previous one
	  --> Create a Product Increment "Done" Usable Potentially releasable
	  --> Length doesn't change after it starts
	  --> Consistent duration throughout development

 During the sprint:
	  --> No changes that would endanger the Goal 
	  --> Quality does not decrease
	  --> Scope may be clarified and renegotiated as more is learned
	  --> Negotiation = Development Team + Product Owner
	  --> Each Sprint =~ project no longer than 1 month long.
 
 Accomplish something
	  --> Has a goal of what to build
	  --> Has a design
	  --> Flexible plan
	  --> Result = Product Increment
 
 Only the Product Owner can cancel, before the time-box is over. May do under the influence of Stakeholders, Development Team or Product Owner.

Sprint Planning:
 Maximum of 8 hours for a one-month Sprint. Shorter event for shorter sprints. For planning the work to be performed during the Sprint.

It answers:
	  --> What can be delivered?
	  --> How will work be achieved?

 By the end of Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain how it intends to self-organise to accomplish the Goal and deliver the Increment.

Sprint Backlog:
 Development Team self-organises to undertake (commit) the work in the Sprint Backlog

 During planning and throughout the Sprint.

Daily Scrum:
	  --> 15 minutes time-box. Regardless team size or Sprint length.
	  --> Internal meeting for the Development Team (others must not disturb) Every day.
	  --> Same place, same time.
	  --> Plan for the next 24 hours.
	  --> Optimises collaboration and performance.
	  --> Key Inspect and Adapt meeting.
 The structure is set by the Development Team

Sprint Review:
	  --> 4 hours for one month Sprint. Shorter event for shorter sprints.
	  --> End of Sprint (before Retrospective).
	  --> What was done in the Sprint.
	  --> Inspect the Product Increment.
	  --> Adapt the Product Backlog.
	  --> Scrum Team + Stakeholders.
	  --> Collaborate on next things to be done to optimise value.

Sprint Retrospective:
	  --> 3 hours for one month Sprint. Shorter event for shorter sprints.
	  --> Formal opportunity for Inspection and Adaptation.
	  --> Scrum Team inspect itself.
	  --> Plan improvements to do next Sprint.
	  --> Make next Sprint more effective and enjoyable.
	  --> Plan how to increase product quality.
	  --> Adapt the Definition of Done if Necessary.
	  --> Not in conflict with organisational standards.

Scrum Artefacts:
	  --> Artefacts represent Work or Value.
	  --> Opportunity to Inspect and Adapt.
	  --> Designed to maximise transparency.

Product Backlog:
	  --> Ordered list of everything needed in the product.
	  --> It is the single source of requirements.
	  --> Belongs solely to the Product Owner.

Sprint Backlog:
	  --> Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering them = forecast by the Development Team about:
	  --> What functionality will be in the next increment and
	  --> Work needed to deliver it as a "Done" increment
	  --> Makes visible the work necessary to deliver the Sprint Goal.
	  --> It is a highly visible real-time picture of the Development Team work.
	  --> It belongs solely to the Development Team.

Increments:
 Increment = Sum of items completed during this Sprint	+ Value of increments from previous Sprints.
	  --> steps towards a goal or version
	  --> multiple increments created with in the sprint supports empiricism.

Definition of Done :
	  --> It guides the Development Team on knowing how many items it can select during Sprint Planning.
	  --> As Scrum Team matures, Definition of Done evolves to higher quality and may uncover work to be done in previously "Done" increments.
