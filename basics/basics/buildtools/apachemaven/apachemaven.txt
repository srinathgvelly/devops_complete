Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications. Build automation is automating the sequence of tasks that are to be made by developer.

 Downloading dependencies -> compile source code -> running tests -> deployment 

Maven is an attempt to apply patterns to a project's build infrastructure in order to promote comprehension and productivity by providing a clear path in the use of best practices. Maven is essentially a project management and comprehension tool and as such provides a way to help with managing:
	 --> Builds
	 --> Documentation
	 --> Reporting
	 --> Dependencies
	 --> SCMs
	 --> Releases
	 --> Distribution
	 --> Mailing list 

 Maven makes life of developer very easy by creating reports, checks, build and testing automation setups.
 Maven is build automation tool used to build java projects.

 Primary goal of Maven:
	 --> Project is resuable, maintainable, easier to comprehend.
	 --> plugins or tolls interact with this type models.

Maven uses Convention over Configuration. Maven creates default project structure so developers need to mention life cycle goals and project dependencies , they doesnt need to build process themselves but they need to place the files accordingly.

Features of Maven:
 	 --> simple project setup
 	 --> usage in all the project
 	 --> Dependency management including automatic updating
 	 --> repositories are more
 	 --> Ability to easily write plugins in java
 	 --> Instant access to new features.
 	 --> Maven can build so many number of projects with predefined outputs such as jar, war, metadata
 	 --> maven can be able to build websites and pdfs
 	 --> Maven can integrate with the scs to manage the projects
 	 --> Maven can support its older versions
 	 --> Automatic parent versioning
 	 --> Maven can build schedule modules in parallel.
 	 --> Maven can report error with the error description.
	 
Maven build lifecycle(standard lifecycle) is set of tasks that are executed when maven build is run.
 	 --> default/build:handles project build and deloyment
 	 --> clean:handles project cleaning
 	 --> site:handles the creation of project site documentation 
	 are three built in build lifecycles

A build phase is made up of set of goals and goes through set of stages in maven built lifecycle.

Maven build phases:
 Maven build lifecycle goes through a set of stages they are called build phases.
 	 --> validate
 	 --> compile
 	 --> testing
 	 --> package
 	 --> verify
 	 --> install
 	 --> deploy	
 when we run a maven build command we specify the phase to be executed,in any maven build phases that
 come before the specified task is also executed i.e., if we run mcn verify then it will execute validate
 compile,test,package phases of the project.
 
Maven Build Goals:
 a build phase is made up of set of goals.Maven goals represents a specific task that contributes 
 to building and managing of a project.
 	 
Role of POM in build lifecycle:
 The maven builds executed through command line runs a set of phases and goals. POM plays a key role in 
 project build lifecycle. The packaging value of pom.xml file defines the set of goals to be be executed by 
 maven project.
